### 3.3. Payment Processing

#### 3.3.1. Overview
Payment processing is a critical feature that leverages Stripe Connect for:

- Automated Rent Collection: Securely processing tenant payments.
- Custom Payment Configurations: Supporting property-specific payment rules including late fee calculation.
- Payment History Tracking: Maintaining an audit-ready ledger of all transactions.

#### 3.3.2. Stripe Connect Integration and Multi-Tenant Payment Flow

**Objectives:**
- **Secure and Individual Onboarding:** Each property manager must connect their bank account individually via the Stripe Connect OAuth flow. The system stores only a non-sensitive reference (the Stripe connected account ID) for each manager.
- **Destination Charges for Seamless Payments:** Tenants pay rent by providing their payment details. The charge is processed using Stripe's destination charge feature, directing funds (after platform fee deductions) to the specific property manager's connected account.
- **Real-Time Transaction Updates:** Webhooks from Stripe immediately update payment statuses and trigger the recording of transactions in the system ledger.
- **Compliance & Security:** All payments are processed using Stripe's PCI-DSS compliant systems. Sensitive data is never stored locally.

**User Stories & Use Cases:**

*Property Manager Onboarding:*
- **User Story:** As a property manager, I want to securely link my bank account via Stripe so that I can receive rent payouts directly.
- **Flow:** Click "Connect with Stripe" → Initiate OAuth process → Complete account linking → Save the connected account reference in the system.

*Tenant Payment:*
- **User Story:** As a tenant, I want to pay my rent online securely, ensuring my payment is processed correctly and reflected in the system.
- **Flow:** Tenant submits payment details → System creates a destination charge in Stripe using the respective property manager's connected account as the destination → Stripe processes the payment → Webhook confirms and records the transaction.

*Automated Disbursement:*
- **User Story:** As a property manager, I want funds to be automatically disbursed to my connected bank account after deducting applicable fees.
- **Flow:** Upon tenant payment confirmation via webhook, the system schedules a payout to the manager, and the dashboard displays the current payout status.

*Handling Refunds/Disputes:*
- **User Story:** As a property manager, I need to manage refunds or disputes in situations of tenant payment issues.
- **Flow:** Initiate a refund or dispute via the Stripe API → Update the payment status and notify both tenant and manager accordingly.
